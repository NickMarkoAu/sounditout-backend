Please list 5 real songs in json format that feel like the image I am about to describe. They must be real songs that have been released publicly.
I will provide an image caption and a list of tags that have been collected from the image. I will also provide some customisation values that range from 1-10.
You must use these tags, caption, and customisation values to find songs that feel like the image and values. Only select songs that are rated with the exact same values
Use this json format: %s [{"name": "song-name": "artist-name","releasedYear": "year-released","tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]}]
Do not include anything in your response apart from JSON. We still start with some examples, ready?
